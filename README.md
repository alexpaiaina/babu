# cookbook

## Project Description

In a day and age where everything seems to move at a quickened pace there seems to be no time to cook for one's self not to mention a family.  These recipes from my grandmother gives certain versatility that is adaptable to the hustle and bustle.  Cookbook will provide different recipes for people on the go, with time, or for a large gatherings and soul fulfilling soups. Create a seemless navigation experience for the user that's not overstimulated, not bored, but walking that line in the middle of both.

### API

I'll be using airtable and axios to render data to cookbook. I will then be able to access data that I'll compile using their database.  Will access these fields from my API.

### API Sample


        {
            "id": "recZraOMLVDdVRL1s",
            "fields": {
                "created_at": "9/3/2020 6:13pm",
                "description": "pasta cheese tomato",
                "ingredients": [
                    "lamb",
                    "goat cheese",
                    "pasta"
                ],

#### MVP 

- convey my data of recipes to the user in a clear manner.  
- have pictures that accompany the dishes for visual appeal
- have functionality of buttons that renders data that is called for.
- clean code
- minimize cruft
- utilize a post call for creating recipe

#### PostMVP  

- Make project more aesthetically pleasing by talking to UX student or come up with polishing up techniques on my own.  
- Create a carousel for my homepage images and get them to change using set interval or another method.  
- Continue refining the website by applying tools learned that will enhance the overall experience.
- Ability to delete and update recipe.

#### SWOT

I have many shortcomings when it comes to this new developing skill.  Knowing this, I will try to get out in front of the project and ask for help as needed instead of waiting.  I'll look back at repositories we were given for the past couple weeks and rerun through lessons to try to explain the process that obstructs my way.  Asking my peers and looking online for help will also be sought out to overcome my lack of and developing knowledge of javaScript/react/html/css.
