        Babu is a shortened nickname for Grandma in Russian, Babushka. She is a
        devote Catholic who married a Russian man, my grandfather or Djeta, when
        he was packing excess pounds like a bear preparing to hibernate. She got
        him on a diet and he lost that weight. </p>

    <div className="aboutPara">
      <p>She makes family meals almost everyday.
      Babu likes eating out like most of us, but eating her food is like
      eating out. She doesn't make things with much salt to the chagrin of
      some family members who are addicted to white powder, sugar and salt.
      That's why the food is so good cause it doesn't hide in any masked
      flavors. You genuinely get to taste the food. It feels good knowing that
      you're eating a healthy meal. What you put in is nourishing the fibers
  that makes you. </p>

   <div className="aboutPara">
      <p>I hope this project goes well, so I can show her the
        utility of this app and hopefully she will have the nerve to share her
  recipes, at the very least, with family.</p >
